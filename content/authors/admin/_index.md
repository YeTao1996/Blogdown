Hi! I am a senior student at University of California, Davis. My interests include Statistics, Data Analysis, Finance, Machine Learning, and programming in R and Python. I am also a semi-professional GO player with 4 Dan certification.

This website basically serves as a playground for me to share some of my study and projects in a more accessible manner and explore the use of data to communicate ideas. I code predominantly in R or Python.
